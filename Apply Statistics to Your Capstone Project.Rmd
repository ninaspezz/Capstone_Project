df <- read_csv('capstone_data_clean.csv')

```
*Get going by asking the following questions and looking for the answers with some code and plots:*

*Can you count something interesting?*

*Can you find some trends (high, low, increase, decrease, anomalies)?*
```{r} 
ggplot(df, aes(x = steps, y = calories_burned)) +
  geom_line()

ggplot(df, aes(x = time_in_bed, y = minutes_asleep)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = minutes_awake))
```

*Can you make a bar plot or a histogram?*
```{r} 
ggplot(df, aes(x = minutes_asleep)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

*Can you compare two related quantities?*
```{r} 
ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = steps, color = minutes_very_active)) +
  geom_line()
```

*Can you make a scatterplot?*
*Can you make a time-series plot?*

```{r} 
ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = number_of_awakenings)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = time_in_bed))
```
