# Capstone Project Proposal: Quantified Self
January 7, 2018

Using personal [FitBit Flex 2](https://www.fitbit.com/flex2) data compiled since October 4, 2017, I will observe the following.

__Activity Data__

* Calories burned
* Steps
* Distance
* Minutes sedentary
* Minutes lightly active
* Minutes fairly active
* Minutes very active
* Activity calories

__Sleep Data__

* Start time
* End time
* Minutes asleep
* Minutes awake
* Number of awakenings
* Time in bed

__Questions to Answer__

* Do correlations exist between activity and sleep?
    + Are high activity days followed by nights of quality sleep (lower numbers of awakenings)?
    + Are high activity days followed by higher minutes of sleep?
* What are my sleep trends?
    + How consistent is my sleep?
    + Were there wild fluctuations in sleep start and end time over the period studied?
    + On what day of the week do I spend the most time in bed?
    + On what day of the week do I spend the most minutes asleep?
    + On what day of the week do I have the most number of awakenings?
    + How does my sleep start time compare on work days vs. non-work days?
    + Do my minutes asleep and sleep start and end times change with the seasons as sunrise and sunset times change?
* What are my activity trends?
    + On what day of the week do I take the most steps?
    + On what day of the week do I spend the most minutes very active?
    + On what day of the week do I take the least steps?
    + On what day of the week do I spend the most minutes sedentary?
    + How much do my steps fluctuate? Am I spending very high activty days followed by very low activity days?
    
__Other Things to Note__

* FitBit tracks daytime naps - strip those out or include?
* Identifying one day in which I didn't wear device to sleep (device was charging)
